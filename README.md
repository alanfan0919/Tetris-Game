# Tetris-Game
This Tetris-Game project is implemented in Python using Pygame package. 
I used Pygameâ€™s APIs to draw a game interface where dropping and landed bricks are displayed. 
Several bricks patterns is pre-defined using 2D array. 
I also implemented key-controlled of bricks rotation and left/right moving.
